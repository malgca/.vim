# Description: This script takes care of the otherwise time consuming task of:
# 			   1. Trawling LinkedIn according to some given criteria and company; and
#			   2. Creating a spreadsheet that will map the information into some kind of matrix.
#			   The hope is that, by using this script, we're able to get capability information pretty quickly from now on instead of having to worry about doing it manually.
